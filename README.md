# AVR-IOT_UV.X
Adding a UV sensor to the AVR-IOT WG board (UV Click), publishing data to the Google IoT Cloud

This is an example of extending the basic AVR-IOT project to include a new sensor (found on the UV Click) 
that is currently not yet supported by MCC.
The main project structure was still created with MPLAB X Code Configurator (MCC) using the AVR-IOT lib v1.1.1
